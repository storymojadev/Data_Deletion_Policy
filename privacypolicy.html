    <h1>Storyhippo Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Storyhippo! Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

We will never request any information from students under 13 years old.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect device identifiers, operating system, app usage statistics (e.g., pages visited, time spent on the app), and other non-personally identifiable information to improve the app's functionality and user experience.</li>

        <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.</li>
        <li>To trusted service providers who assist us in operating the app, provided they adhere to this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>For Teachers and School Administrators with subscriptions, we may share anonymized and aggregated data about student app usage to demonstrate the app's effectiveness within the classroom setting. Parents of students using the app within a school subscription will be notified of this practice.</li>
    </ul>
